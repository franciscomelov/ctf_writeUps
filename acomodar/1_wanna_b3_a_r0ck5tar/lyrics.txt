Rocknroll is right              
Silence is wrong                
A guitar is a six-string        
Tommy's been down               
Music is a billboard-burning razzmatazz!
Listen to the music             
If the music is a guitar(10 para 10 == 10)                  
Say "Keep on rocking!"                
Listen to the rhythm
If the rhythm without Music is nothing (170 para 170 -170 = null)
Tommy is rockin guitar
Shout Tommy!                    
Music is amazing sensation 
Jamming is awesome presence
Scream Music!                 
Scream Jamming!  
Tommy is playing rock         
Scream Tommy!       
They are dazzled audiences               
Shout it!
shout "--"  
Rock the electric heaven 
Scream it!
Tommy is jukebox god            
Say it!                                     
Break it down
Shout "Bring on the rock!"
Else Whisper "That ain't it, Chief"                 
Break it down
