## Challenge name
Authorization 06

## description
In this exercise, you can register an account. However, you won't be part of an organisation. The goal is to join the organisation Organisation #1

To do so you will need to set your organisation using mass-assignment.

By convention (can be changed programmatically) when a developer uses ActiveRecord (Ruby-on-Rails' most common data mapper), and a class Organisation has multiple User's, the relation is managed using a field organisation_id inside the User class.

The following code is used in Ruby:
```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :organisation
end
 
class Organisation < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :users
end
```
You can guess the fact that organisation is used by visiting the organisation page and looking at the URL. You will see that the class is probably named Organisation. And therefore the key in the users table is likely to be organisation_id.

Ruby-on-Rails enforces "convention" over "configuration" which really helps to guess class names and attributes' name...
Using this information, you should be able to set your current organisation to get access to the "key".

## solution
this Challenge is similar two the last one
- we have to get an organisation role in this case, 
- we get a form and can make an user, but we get an error becausewe have to be part of organisation#1 to get the flag
- the form creates a request
```
user[username]=myuser&
user[password]=myuser&
submit=Enviar
```
- in this case `user[organisation_id]=1` won't work because we don't need an admin role
- we will try
  - user[id]=1
  - user[organisation]=1
  - user[organisation_id]=1
- `user[organisation_id]=1` worked correctly and gave us an organisation#1 role
- the full request is
