## Challenge name
Authentication 04

## description
To remediate the previous issue, the developer decided to use a case-sensitive comparison during user creation.

This check can also be bypassed based on the way MySQL performs string comparison: MySQL ignores trailing spaces (i.e.: pentesterlab and pentesterlab[space] are equals). Using the same method as above, you should be able to pretend to be logged in as the user admin.

## solution
- go to the url
- Using the information from the description, "pentesterlab and pentesterlab[space] are equals", we know what we have to does
- create a new user "admin ":pass
- When the databases sees "admin " (with a space) it think is the same as "admin"
- Now we are logged as "admin" and we weg the flag from the page

## flag
```
flag{}
```
