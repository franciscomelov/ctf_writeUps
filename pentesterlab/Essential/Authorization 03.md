## Challenge name
Authorization 03

## description
In this example, you can see an example of a classic mistake with modern frameworks.

Here, most of the code is generated automatically and access to different formats (HTML, JSON) for the same database record, is also done automatically.

For example, by accessing /users/1, you will see a HTML page with the first user's details. However, the scoring key has been masked.

Fortunately, you should be able to access the JSON representation of this user's details by modifying the URL.

## solution
- go to the URL
- the is a table
- 1 - admin email - show (button)
- clickin in the show button, show some info
<details>
  <summary>key</summary>

```
Email: admin@libcurl.so
Key: ########-####-####-####-############

```
</details>

- the key is not ensrypted, but only shows "#####"
- from the instruction, we sould be able to see the json version os the page
- changin the url from
  - www.url.meurl/users/1
  - www.url.meurl/users/xxxxx

using the correct url will show the json version of the page, and in this version the key is shown correctly


## flag
