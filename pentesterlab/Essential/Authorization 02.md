## Challenge name
Authorization 02


## description
In this example, you can access the information using a method similar to the one seen previously.

You cannot just directly access the information, however you can see that you are now able to edit information.

You can use this feature to access information from other users just by incrementing the number in the URL.

## solution
- go to the url
- using the given credentials "user1:pentesterlab"
- in the page there are 2 posts, the url follows the same structure
  - url/infos/1, url/infos/1
  - there ar 2 posts
  - changing the url /infos/x will give an error
  - /infos/x in this case is protected
- each post has an "edit" button
- /infos/x/edit
  - in crementing the number works with this path
- change to the correct number and the flag wil be shown in the page
