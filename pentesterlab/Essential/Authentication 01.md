## Challenge name

Authentication 01

## description

In this exercise, you can log in as user1.

Your goal is to get logged in as admin. To do so, you need to carefully look at the response sent back by the server.

You can see that when you log in as user1, you get a cookie named user1.

From the cookie, you can easily modify a value (using a proxy or a browser's extension) to get logged in as admin.

## solution

- go to the url.
- create a new user in register
  - user:password1

- logged as user1 and using a proxy we can see the cookies.

```
{"url":"https://ptl-1d7d5648d681-1ed308b21802.libcurl.me","cookies":[{"domain":"ptl-1d7d5648d681-1ed308b21802.libcurl.me","hostOnly":true,"httpOnly":false,"name":"auth","path":"/","sameSite":"unspecified","secure":false,"session":true,"storeId":"0","value":"user1"}]}
```
- this part in specific: `,"value":"user1"}]}`
where we can see the user we are currently logged as. "user1"
- the login information is in plain text, so changing the value from "user1" to "admin" should log us on as the new value "flag"
