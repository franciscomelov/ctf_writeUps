authentication 01

## description
This example shows the consequence of different methods of string comparison.

When you create a user, the application will check programmatically that the user does not exist by comparing the username provided with the existing users.

When you log in, the application will check that your username and password are correct, and then it will save your username in your session.

Finally, every time you access the application, the application will retrieve your user's details based on the username provided in the session.

The trick here comes from the fact that the comparison when you create a user is done programmatically (i.e.: in Ruby) but when the user's details get retrieved, the comparison is done by the database. By default, MySQL (with the type VARCHAR) will perform a case-insensitive comparison: "admin" and "Admin" are the same value.

Using this information, you should be able to create a user that will be identified as admin.

## solution
- got o the url
- create an user
  - user:pass
- cheking coockies
  - the data is hashed usin sha-256, so we wont be able to reverse it like the other challenges
- using the help from this challenges description
  - ...By default, MySQL (with the type VARCHAR) will perform a case-insensitive comparison: "admin" and "Admin" are the same value.
  - We now there is an "admin" user, but we don't know the password
- we can create an "Admin" user, it will be different than "admin", but when comparing "Admin" to "admin" the "case-insensitive comparison" will make it think is the same user

- creating "Admin:pass" user
- when we log as "Admin" we will be logged as "admin" and get the flag
 

## flag
```
