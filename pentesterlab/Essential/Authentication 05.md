## description
In this challenge, the problem is completely different from the previous ones.

Here the issue comes from the way the user gets redirected back to the login page.

The developer forgot to stop the execution after redirecting users to the login page. By carefully inspecting the responses sent back by the server, you should be able to get the key.

## solution
- go to the url
  - it goes directly to www.url.e/login.php
  - even if yo go type www.url.me it redirectsto the login page
- we can create an user or visit another page
- we will see the response/request with burp suite

In the burp  suite proxy and browser
- go to www.url.me
  - the request is:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
...
...
```
- go forward
  - it automatically generates the response
```
GET /login.php HTTP/1.1
...
...
```
- The browser doesn't show what is in ```GET / HTTP/1.1``` because the request redirects automatically to ```GET /login.php HTTP/1.1```
- we use the repeater to see the of response ```GET / HTTP/1.1``` 
- go to www.url.me
- send the request to te repeater
- see the response
- We get the flag in the response
